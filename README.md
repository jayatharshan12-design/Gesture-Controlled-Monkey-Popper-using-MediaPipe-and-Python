# Gesture-Controlled-Monkey-Popper-using-MediaPipe-and-Python
Built a fun computer-vision system that detects hand gestures through the webcam using MediaPipe and OpenCV. When a specific gesture is recognized, a monkey image pops up on the screen. Learned about real-time landmark tracking, image overlay, and timing control in Python.
